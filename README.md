# react-dropzone
An upload component using React-dropzone and integrating it with Google Drive, Notion, and Dropbox. 


Here are few tips i can give on "handleFileUploads" function  :
To handle the `handleFileUpload` logic for Google Drive, Notion, and Dropbox integrations, you'll need to integrate their respective APIs and implement the necessary functionality for uploading files. Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach each integration:

1. **Google Drive Integration**: 
   To integrate with Google Drive, you'll need to use the Google Drive API. Here are the general steps:
   - Set up a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Drive API.
   - Obtain the necessary credentials (API key or OAuth client ID) for authentication.
   - Implement the logic to authenticate the user and obtain an access token to make API requests.
   - Use the Google Drive API to upload files to the user's Google Drive account.

   The specific implementation details can be quite involved, so I recommend referring to the Google Drive API documentation for a comprehensive guide on setting up the integration and handling file uploads.

2. **Notion Integration**: 
   Notion does not provide an official API for file uploads. However, you can leverage third-party libraries or unofficial APIs to achieve the integration. Here's a possible approach:
   - Use a third-party library or an unofficial Notion API wrapper that supports file uploads.
   - Authenticate the user using the necessary credentials (e.g., API token).
   - Implement the logic to upload files to a specific Notion page or database.

   Note that this approach relies on unofficial APIs, and there might be limitations or potential risks associated with using them. Ensure you review and understand the terms and conditions of the library or API you choose to use.

3. **Dropbox Integration**: 
   To integrate with Dropbox, you'll need to use the Dropbox API. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:
   - Create a new app in the Dropbox App Console and generate the necessary API credentials.
   - Implement the logic to authenticate the user and obtain an access token for making API requests.
   - Use the Dropbox API to upload files to the user's Dropbox account.

   The Dropbox API provides comprehensive documentation with examples and guides to help you with the integration process. Refer to the Dropbox API documentation for detailed instructions on setting up the integration and handling file uploads.

Each integration requires its own set of steps and considerations. It's important to thoroughly review the documentation and guidelines provided by each service to ensure you adhere to their requirements and best practices.

Please note that implementing the complete logic for each integration is beyond the scope of a single response, as it involves multiple steps and considerations. You may need to refer to the respective API documentation and libraries to build out the detailed implementation for each integration.
